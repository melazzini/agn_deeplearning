# AGN Spectral Analysis Using Deep Learning

In this project, I want to apply deep learning to a set of agn  x-ray spectra, obtained from Mote Carlo simulations, and see what information we can extract from those spectra.
By information we mean physical parameters like the column density or Iron abundance.
